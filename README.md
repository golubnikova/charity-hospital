## Introduction
The [Charitable Hospital](https://charityhospital.ru/) is a non-profit organization that provides comprehensive medical and social assistance to the homeless, migrants, refugees, and people without documents and citizenship since 2018.  

Data was recorded and managed with the REDCap system, a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies. The REDCap system is collecting data on every homeless patient who seeks medical help. This is a unique practice for Russia and the analysis of the collected data (1633 unique patients) will help to improve service for homeless people in protecting their health.


## Aim, tasks and data
The aim of this project was to perform the database analysis and identify the patterns in the incidence (morbidity) of homeless patients.

Tasks:
1. describe the portrait of a homeless patient
2. determine the influence of the place of sleeping on the presence of any disease
3. cluster homeless patients by places of assistance and identify specific charactercistics of these clusters (health and socio-economic indicators)
4. identify the relationship between calling an ambulance (AMS) and the state of the homeless patient, build a predictive model for calling an ambulance
